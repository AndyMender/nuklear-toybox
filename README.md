# nuklear-toybox
A set of GUI libraries using the Nuklear UI toolkit. Since Nuklear is written in ANSI C (C89),
I will try to make these tools ANSI C (or ISO C) compliant as well.

# Build
Refer to the .travis.yml Travis CI YAML config for build instructions.

# Requirements
The nuklear.h headers need to be in `/usr/include` or `/usr/local/include`. Available [here](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear).
